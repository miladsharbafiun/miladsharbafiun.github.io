I've finished my MS in Condensed Matter Physics, in 2018. My Master's thesis was about the study of the effect of disorder on the quantum transport of Phosphorene Nanoribbons. During my studies I have been introduced and trained on a variety of subjects including Quantum Mechanics, Solid State of Physics and Nanophysics. I also have self-studied the basics of Computational Physics and numerical simulations in Quantum Mechanics with Python, Fortran and have some experience with other programming languages, such as C++. I have the experience of using various numerical libraries such as Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) in Fortran and NumPy, SciPy and Pybinding in Python. I'm interested in data science and its applications in physics.
Currently I'm working on different projects related to Business Intelligence. Also I'm working on several medical data analysis projects.
I believe that physics is a strong passion of making model for everything and data is our best chance to achieve, So we have to let data talk.
Every data scientist is usually interested in everything that includes data and today almost everything produces data. So I'm interested in almost everything ðŸ˜Š.
