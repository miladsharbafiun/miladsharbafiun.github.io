I obtained my M.Sc. degree in Condensed Matter Physics from University of Isfahan, Iran, in 2018. My Master's thesis was about the study of the effect of disorder on the quantum transport of Phosphorene Nanoribbons. During my studies I have been introduced and trained on a variety of subjects including Quantum Mechanics, Solid State of Physics and Nanophysics. I also have self-studied the basics of Computational Physics and numerical simulations in Quantum Mechanics with Python, Fortran and have some experience with other programming languages, such as C++. I have the experience of using various numerical libraries such as Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) in Fortran and NumPy, SciPy and Pybinding in Python.
